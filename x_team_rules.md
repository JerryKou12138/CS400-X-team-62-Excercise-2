# X-Team 62 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
    - use our group message to delegate what needs to be done
    - volunteer first for tasks, then choose randomly
    - first make sure everyone knows how to do their task, if not we can swap tasks


## How we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
    - use our group message to alert each other when tasks are complete
    - set soft deadlines a few days prior to make sure it gets done


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
    - set up times to meet to discuss potential solutions to our problems
    - use our group message to ask questions to each other


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
    - constantly offer suggestions and check in with group members who haven't completed their task
    - if it comes down it, other group members will complete the task and explain their methods
                - the person who didn't complete their task will complete more work the next project
    - if someone is finished early with their part, they could help out another group member
